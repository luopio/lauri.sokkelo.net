                    Eight displays, five computers and four speakers were deployed in a hallway to present a vast
                    amount of video, text and images to museum visitors. At certain intervals that were also affected
                    by people entering the space the continuous flow of information was interrupted and all the
                    displays started to play the same video with audio surrounding the user in the space.

                    Presented during the TaiK 140 years exhibition at the Helsinki Design museum, the installation
                    showed highlights and important moments from the history of the university.
                    Text content was used to inform about nearby events and upcoming workshops.

                    Created with Niko Knappe and GÃ¶kce Taskan. The setup runs on top of custom code and commodity
                    hardware.
