                    History Flow provided an introduction to the visitors of the Taik 140 exhibition. As they rose up
                    the stairs leading into the exhibition space visuals projected on the opposite side of the stairs
                    showed highlights of the university history. The first step started with the creation of the
                    facility and with each step progressed towards the current day.

                    Several people could walk the stairs simultaneously, each having their own moment in history.

                    Created with Niko Knappe and GÃ¶kce Taskan. The piece runs on top of a Mac mini using a regular
                    web camera and projector. The software used is all custom code.
