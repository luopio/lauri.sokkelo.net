                    A mobile programming workshop at the Media lab expanded into a quick game project. PENALTI is built
                    for the S60 phones using the Python programming language.

                    The goal is to race a ball through a course as fast as possible by tilting the phone.
                    While this is a fairly normal game mechanic, the real innovation comes from the form of
                    collaborative game play: as soon as the ball leaves your screen it lands on the screen of the
                    next player and he has to continue as quickly as possible to get that fastest lap that you want.

                    The game was submitted to the Nokia Game Competition and won best of TaiK
