PetHotelCMS is a Client Management System I'm making for a pet hotel. It's quite simple but has a few nice / advanced features such as a client - server -architechture that allows multiple clients to access and modify the client database. Currently the database is MySQL but using any other DBAPI2.0 compliant db should be no problem. 

..and it's a python project. The client will be implemented on python and gtk (once i manage to desing the interface), so it's linux only.
