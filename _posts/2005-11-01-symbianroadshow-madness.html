So I took part in the SymbianRoadshow-training/recruitment day offered by <a href="http://www.vega.fi/fi/">Vega technologies</a>. Learned quite a lot of stuff about symbian, played around with a few phones (even one that wasn't available on the market yet), broke some example code the lecturer had done and finally drank beer, ate pizza and enjoyed a nice relaxing sauna evening. All this paid by Vega. <br />
<br />
I probably won't work for them in the future (symbian didn't look so "developer-friendly", nor am I so interested in symbian programming), but at least they succeeded in giving a nice image of the business. I'm sure to recommend it to anyone looking for a developer job in symbian programming. Thanks for the education, pizza, beer and the sauna Vega!
