Using the newest-state-of-the-art software isn't always the best solution... I tried the newest <a href="http://www.suspend2.net">software suspend</a> on my laptop and it screwed my /, meaning I couldn't boot my linux anymore. <u>Thank god I have my home-directories on a separate partition</u>! <br />
<br />
Anyway. All is well now. Running a fresh <a href="http://ubuntulinux.org">Ubuntu 5.10</a> linux now (didn't really have the time or energy to go through a stage 1 gentoo install (and stage 3 is only for pussies ;) ) ). I don't recommend trying the 2.2-rc1 suspend on your only computer.. It seems to be reiserfs-related.. I'm sure Nigel will fix it soon.
