It's that time of year again. Scream, kick, bite and crawl to get yer ass employed for the summer. That means that I'll try to improve this site a bit, finish off Pet Hotel Receptionist (almost done) and create a nice, appealing CV (without cheating ;) )<br />
<br />
.. And I'll have to get a job because I just paid taxes from my latest projectsalary with a nice tax percent of 34%. Damn taxofficials messed up my taxcard in Kuopio :-P. I'll get my money back, but not until christmas.
