Yesterday I finished the last bits of Pet Hotel - the client management system for pet hotels. Programming GTK with Python was fun and fast compared to doing Java or Win.Forms stuff.<br />
<br />
I'll make a webpage for the program and put it there (it's GPL). Don't think it'll help a lot of ppl, because it's designed for such a specific purpose, but just in case...
