I had to install Ubuntu Dapper to get my hands on gstreamer 0.10. A friend of mine had success with XGL/Compiz with ATI and I decided to give it a try since it's so easy with Dapper. I have to say it is incredible. Thanks to David Reveman and all the other giants for making this possible!!<br />

It made my desktop quicker, prettier and more easy to use (expose effects, etc.). Here's a screenie for explanation. The 
effect in question is the switching of workspaces. Soundgarden is playing between. Click on it to get a bigger 
view.<br />

Although it's still alpha software, it works nicely. A few complaints still: windows from all workspaces show up in alt-tab-switcher and getting video to work required some tweaking. This tweaking resulted in the problem that window-decoration-cross won't close mplayer (have to press q). These are minor issues. On the whole I have to say this is the best thing I've seen on Linux in a long time! At last my desktop does not pale in comparison to Mac OS X (not to mention windows :) ).
