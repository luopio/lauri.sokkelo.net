Bought a new(used) phone from huuto.net. The model is Sony Ericsson k750i. My first non-Nokia phone and I have to say I'm quite pleased. Don't even need windows for importing mp3s into it, it shows up nicely as a remote card reader on my Ubuntu Dapper. <br />
<br />
The only problem is syncing with Evolution, which is currently impossible(?). I hope this gets fixed, as it would be very nice to share the calendar and tasks between the laptop and the phone.<br />
<br />
And in other news: I got into the <a href="http://www.coss.fi/kesakoodi">COSS kes√§koodi</a> final (google summer of code kinda thing)! The final will take place next Tuesday in Helsinki. I hope I'll get the job (and good luck to the other contestants).
