It was a nice weekend, if you don't count the fact that my /home was destroyed... Buying a (microsoft) XBox 360 gamepad so that we could play a game with <a href="http://tuomas.sokkelo.net">Tuomas</a> forced me to upgrade my WinXP to SP2 (I know, long due). This upgrade failed. Windows gave a brilliant error report: "incorrect parameter" and failed to start. As a nice side-effect it distorted the partition table somehow and destroyed my home-partition. F*cking windows.<br />
<br />
Thank god I had some backups, but they're a month old. This means all my gdesklets work is lost (and movies, music, configurations for all the programs).. We'll I guess it's time to buy a usb-harddrive for better backups.<br />
<br />
And tomorrow I have the COSS-summercode finals.. hope I make it.
