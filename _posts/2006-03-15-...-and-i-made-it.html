Tight kes√§koodi-finals.. eight people got in, seven showed up (no idea why one didn't), five got picked, and I was 
one of them! <b>Hooray!</b> Now I get to work on <a href="http://www.gdesklets.org">gDesklets</a> all summer. Something I would have done (a bit) anyway.<br />
<br />
I'll create a new category on the blog for reporting on how my gDesklets work is progressing.<br />
<br />
And I got a 250GB LaCie (Porsche design :-* ) USB-hardrive. That combined with the nice and simple backup utility <a href="http://sbackup.sourceforge.net/HomePage">"SBackup"</a> should keep my /home and all the work safe.<br />
<br />
I should be working on my Agent software article, but I think I'll hack a little on KISSsmilies..
