Added KISSsmilies to the ever-growing KISS libraries. It will convert all "ASCII-smileys" into image-elements. Just like this :) :-D 8-) .. Ooooh :-o ! This just opens new worlds ;) !<br />
<br />
.. and everything is done via javascript, so the work of conversion is done by your computer, oh gracious viewer :) .
