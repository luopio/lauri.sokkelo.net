I started working today. I'll try to get ahead as much as possible this week, since I'll be cruising around central Europe from the 22th until 18th of June. I think I can get some work done on the road as well, but I can't promise anything.<br />
<br />
My workplan remains the same and it can be viewed <a href="http://lauri.sokkelo.net/files/workplan.png">here</a>. I think I'll manage doing few of the controls this week and that way I won't get behind in schedule.
