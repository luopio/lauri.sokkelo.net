Did some work on the controls as described in the workplan. The early alpha versions are available <a href="http://lauri.sokkelo.net/gdesklets">here</a>. <br />
* GST-control works, but has some known problems<br />
* RSS-control should work nicely, but I haven't had the time to test it yet<br />

Today I'll head out to central Europe and I'll be back on the 18th of June. During the trip I'll try to get a part of the documentation done and perhaps start on the DTD.
