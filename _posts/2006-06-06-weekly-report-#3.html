Haven't really done anything since leaving Austria and 
arriving in Germany. Mainly because I have no time and no constant access to a computer. Have been checking my mail though and there's been some discussion about a terrible <b>bug</b> on the gdesklets site. I'd be happy to fix it (quite good with php), but I don't have the "resources" right now :-(.<br />
<br />
Another topic is <b>JavaScript support for gDesklets</b>. This way we 
could possibly display Apple's Dashboard widgets. <a 
href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2006/01/22/jackfield-apples-dashboard-for-the-linux-gnome-desktop">This 
started the discussion</a>. I agree with Christian and Martin: encouraging DHTML(HTML+CSS+JS) instead of clean Python+XML is not a very good idea. However the possibility of supporting JS as a scripting language is not entirely discarded.
