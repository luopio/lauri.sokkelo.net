Ok. So my summer 2006 trip so far: Tampere -> Wien (by plane through Frankfurt and Zurich) -> Klagenfurt (train). In Klagenfurt we went to see Riitta and Stefan and after that continued to Germany to see <a href="http://hannu.sokkelo.net">Hannu</a> and Senni. Had fun, drank beer, went to Rock-im-Park. <br />
<br />
Then I continued to Latvia. Aino went to Finland. I spent one night alone here (actually not that alone, met Scottish people and a few soldiers from U.S, stationed in Germany) before Tuomas arrived. Now he's here and we've been around town with Irina, our lovely guide Tuomas contacted through <a href="http://www.hospitalityclub.org">hospitality club</a>. She was great: showed us all the sights and had the energy to direct us to the best bars (also thanks to Sofie, who also enlightened me on Riga history).<br />
<br />
Once we got back to the hostel I got some bad news: the american soldiers got their wallets stolen last night in a night club (Essential) we we're hanging out at (thank god we left earlier). That wasn't the worse: some guy got drugged in the club and mugged/robbed afterwards :-(. <br />
<br />
Tomorrow we're heading towards the awesome Palace of Science and Museum of Occupation. Irina promised to show us around Jurmala if we have the energy after wandering the whole day.
