And here is the first exception to the Sunday rule :-).<br />
<br />
* Beagle control works, but integration into gdesklets-core is problematic (running gobject.mainloop inside another mainloop seems to be the problem)<br />
* Seeker - a display to use the beagle control is under development <br />
* AudioPlayer control was improved in a collaborative session with the collaborative editor "gobby". This was the first time I used a collaborative editor and it seemed to work quite nicely! Participating we're both of the main developers (Martin and Christian) and me. <br />
<br />
* Next week I'll improve the docs as soon as Beagle control becomes stable or stablish..<br />
<br />
And as usual the fruits of labour are available <a href="http://lauri.sokkelo.net/gdesklets">here</a>
