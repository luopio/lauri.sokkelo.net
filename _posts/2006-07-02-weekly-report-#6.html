* Improved the <a href="http://gdesklets.gotdns.org/gDeskletsWiki/Controls">control documentation</a> and wrote the <a href="http://gdesklets.gotdns.org/gDeskletsWiki/ADL-parser">DTD</a> as described in the workplan<br />
* Fixed the RSS-control and started work on RSSboy - a simple RSS reader desklet. Currently the desklet reads one source nicely, but I'm planning on adding support for multiple sources<br />
* Next week I'll start thinking about the new GUI for gDesklets. Instead of creating a normal GUI with GTK, the whole user interface might be a desklet that is capable of controlling other desklets. This is something we've already discussed in the wiki. My other plans include adding real tree style DOM-support to the parser as described on <a href="http://gdesklets.gotdns.org/gDeskletsWiki/Brainstorming">this wiki page.</a>
