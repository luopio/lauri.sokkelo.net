This week I've been mostly...<br />* hacking to get real DOM support in the core. This idea was however rejected by the others. The end result is to provide a "children" property to all container elements. This I'll probably do next week. <br />* implementing proper i18n support and writing a <a href="http://gdesklets.gotdns.org/gDeskletsWiki/HowTo/UseLocalization"> howto in the wiki</a>. <br />* <a href="http://gdesklets.gotdns.org/gDeskletsWiki/Proposal/StyleSupport">planning the style support</a>. This is something I'll start implementing next week.<br /><br />
This week I was also contacted by Ashwin, a biochemist from India. He was also working on a <a href="http://gdesklets.gotdns.org/gDeskletsWiki/DeskletsDesklet"> GUI</a> for gD. We've been hacking together on it now and it looks very promising.<br /><br />
