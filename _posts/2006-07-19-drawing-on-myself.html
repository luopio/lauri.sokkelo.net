Just came back from the tattoo shop "Halo". After one and half hours of getting punctured, my old tattoo finally got upgraded :) 
<br />The artist in Halo was very talented and nice. Overall the experience was a lot more positive than the first tattooing in Kuopio (at Tino's). Even the pain of getting stinged with a small needle hundred times per second got quite pleasant after the first 30 minutes. 
<br />
<br />Now if the wounds would just heal quickly..
