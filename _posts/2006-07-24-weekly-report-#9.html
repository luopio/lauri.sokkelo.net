Missed the <i>sunday deadline</i>, but anyway here's what I've been up to:
<ul><li>Did the children property for container elements
</li><li>Continued work on <i>Baskerville</i> - a beagle seach desklet I used to test the search functionality
</li><li>Created a control for the Desklets Desklet (new gui). It does not function properly yet, because it's aimed for 040 core and all things have not yet been agreed on. Ashwin can however use it to test the display frontend.
</li><li>Wrote Behavior classes for the core - another of those a bit boring chores that needed doing to reach 040.
</li></ul><br />... and in other news: style support was moved to version 0.41, so I won't work on it this summer (see <a href="http://gdesklets.gotdns.org/gDeskletsWiki/RoadMap/0.40">the Roadmap on the wiki</a>). This week I'll be focusing on the Baskerville desklet and  Desklets Desklet with Ashwin.
