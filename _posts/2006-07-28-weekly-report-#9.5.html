This is a half-week-report. I'm going away for the weekend and won't be connected to the internet until next week so I'll explain what I'll do/I've done now: 
<ul><li>The Baskerville desklet for beagle searches is quite complete. It can be seen <a href="http://lauri.sokkelo.net/gdesklets/Baskerville">here</a> and a screenie is <a href="http://lauri.sokkelo.net/gdesklets/baskerville.png">here</a>. It still lacks support for actually launching stuff from the found results...
</li><li>...which brings me to what I'll be up to this weekend: <a href="http://gdesklets.gotdns.org/gDeskletsWiki/Proposal/LauncherControl">the Launcher Control</a>. This will make it possible to launch applications from desklets (user specified "<i>favourite</i>" apps). This is closely related to my other idea of <i>"global preferences"</i>, that are shared among desklets (see <a href="http://gdesklets.gotdns.org/gDeskletsWiki/Brainstorming">Untargetted/Core section of the Brainstorming page</a>)</li></ul>
