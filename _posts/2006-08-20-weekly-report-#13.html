This week I've done <u>really</u> long hours and accomplished...
<ul><li>in releasing <b>Desklets Desklet</b> <a href="http://lauri.sokkelo.net/gdesklets/dd-20-8-06.tar.gz">alpha version</a>. It's actually closer to a beta, but not quite there yet. Of course the biggest downer is that it's designed ultimately for 040, which is not here yet... But the current DD <b>can actually be used for desklet management</b> :-D
</li><li>improving <b>Desklet Control</b> so that it now supports actual installing and starting and removing of desklets (network transparently :-o ).
</li></ul><br />I'm quite happy with this week. I managed to almost catch up with the workplan. Next week I'll continue doing long hours on the DD and start thinking about the Graphical Desklet Editor. Unfortunately the wiki is still down, so I'll have to do design locally. I would love to do the server side php/python to create a dynamic XML-file for DD, but I don't have access to the server. I'll ask if I can get one next week.
