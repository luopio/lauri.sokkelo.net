Last week I managed to...
<ul><li>Release a bug fix + a few new features to <b>DD</b>. It can now wait for 0.40 to reach a more stable form. Then I'll continue on it so that it'll work nicely with it. 
</li><li>A few plans and proposals about the <b>GDE</b> (Graphical Desklet Editor) and desklet packet structure. I'll post them on the wiki as soon as it gets back online (should be around the 30th). 
</li><li><b>UrbanExplainer</b> - a desklet (and a control) to query words from <a href="http://urbandictionary.com">Urban Dictionary</a>. A screenie <a href="http://lauri.sokkelo.net/gdesklets/UrbanExplainer.png">here</a> and the packet <a href="http://lauri.sokkelo.net/gdesklets/UrbanExplainer.tar.gz">here</a>. 
</li></ul>
 
<ul><li>This week I'll continue planning the <b>GDE</b> and looking for possible implementation solutions. I'll also write a <b>HTML-control</b> to support easy HTML-fetching and analyzing through desklets (good for doing web-queries). I'll write a <a href="http://dict.leo.org">dict.leo.org</a> desklet to test it. </li></ul>
