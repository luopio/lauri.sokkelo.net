While attending a lecture today, I got the idea for a very simple video player that uses the <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org">Gstreamer</a> framework. I know <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/totem/">Totem</a>, but I was thinking about something more like <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">Mplayer</a>, but with Gstreamer as the backend.. 
<br />
<br />Could be a nice idea for a small project.. perhaps I'll write one at some point. The basic requirements would be:
<ul><li>Use playbin inside gstreamer to play all media files gst supports
</li><li>When the user clicks on a video clip, only a window playing it will appear. Nothing else. This is the thing I love about mplayer!
</li><li>OSD-support for displaying status, volume, etc. (like mplayer). BUT perhaps with interactive OSD elements like buttons.
</li><li>A context menu that appears on right click. This should be the only toolkit dependable part (Qt, GTK, etc.).
</li><li>If the user does not supply a target clip, the window will play a non-intrusive, but cool usage-video (like tips on a black background).
</li></ul>
