Did the mistake of checking my new pages through IE and noticed how messed up they were... After a bit of tweaking I got them working ok. Thanks to the excellent <a href="http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/">IEs4Linux-project</a> I did not have to enter window$ to fix the issues.
<br />
I found a <a href="http://mar.anomy.net/entry/2006/11/23/00.06.40/">nice snippet</a> for fast IE-detection and used that to disable decorative png-pictures that are relying on transparency. I also had to make the side menu's position "absolute", because "fixed" just does not work on IE<7. 
<br />
Unfortunately the gallery won't work nicely with IE6. <b>It does however work on IE5.5</b>. I guess they just broke the overflow-property at some point :-P .
