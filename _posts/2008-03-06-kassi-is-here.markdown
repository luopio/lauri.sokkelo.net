I've finally managed to integrate "Kassi"   - my new blog engine that is already in use at [kommari.net](http://www.kommari.net) - on my own pages. This will give me the opportunity to easily upload photos and text written in Markup.

The main motivation to get this working as fast as possible was my trip to Hong Kong, Malaysia and Cambodia that begins tomorrow at 3AM. Hopefully I'll be able to send photos and write something during the adventure.		

[EDIT] Oh yeah.. forgot to mention that the pages themselves got a facelift as well. [/EDIT]
