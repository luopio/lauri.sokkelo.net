Second full day at Siem Reap started - like the days of so many other tourists - at 5AM with a tuktuk-drive to see sunrise at Angkor Wat. Place was already packed at that time. After eating breakfast in a food stall inside Angkor Thom, we saw Bayon, the weirdest of the Temples, Ta Prohm - also known as _The Tombraider Temple_ - and several other magnificent structures.

The whole area is enormous and after a short while we're already suffering _temple-fatigue_, a variation of church-fatigue that everyone who's been church-sightseeing in Europe knows.

Now I'm tired. We promised to drink with out tuktuk-driver today, but I'm not sure if I have the strength :)
