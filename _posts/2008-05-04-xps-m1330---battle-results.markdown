After all the struggling, my final solution is to have Vista on one 50GB partition and Linux on the rest. **No damn MediaDirect bloatware anymore**.

My home key now boots into windows and my normal powerkey into GRUB and linux. Just perfect :).

Huge thanks to "Mario666" for his [howto on notebookreview forums](http://forum.notebookreview.com/showthread.php?t=231747).

**Just remember to run the command line in Vista as Administrator** (right click the icon in the start menu). Otherwise the rmbr.exe command will just throw a useless error.
