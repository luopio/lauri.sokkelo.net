I can imagine a handful of huge telecommunications corporations are making huge profits on almost useless pieces of strange teleconferencing solutions that they sell to high level managers in big organizations.

Yes, I'm looking at you [Konftel](http://www.direco.fi/) (and glancing at you Sonera).

If we'd all just jump to the internet age and use skype, or better yet, ekiga, or [wengophone](http://www.wengophone.com).
