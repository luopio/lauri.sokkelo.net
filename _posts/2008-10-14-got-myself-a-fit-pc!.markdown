Ordered myself a [fit-pc from Compulabs](http://www.fit-pc.com/new/about-fit-pc.html) from the States. Thanks to the weak dollar it was more cheaper to order it from there than from Sweden. I was first excited about getting myself a [Bubba server](http://excito.com/bubba/about-bubba.html), which would have been nicer since the shop which makes them is Swedish but technically Bubba is missing a lot of the things that fit-pc has, while consuming more power in the process (not a lot though).

Now I need to come up with a purpose for my fit-pc :). I guess I'll cram a 250GB HDD into it, install gentoo (need performance) and tweak it to run as a wifi-router/backup-server/web-photo-server/automatic-backupper/audio-player/bittorrent-downloader -mean-machine. It's claimed to be powerful enough to play basic divx-clips, but I'm not planning on putting myth or anything on it.

All this under 300e.. let's see how it turns out.
