Silently we (me and Jari Suominen from Medialab) released PENALTI - a fun ball racing game that uses the accelerometer available on many symbian (s60) phones. The idea started from mlab's Rapid Mobile Prototyping workshop and was fueled by Nokia Forum Game Development challenge.

We did a few days of intensive coding and submitted our game. Didn't win the whole thing, but we were the best in TaiK (dunno, if anyone else participated :) ). Prize? A Nokia 5800 phone. Suits me fine, since my trustworthy ericsson is falling apart and the N95's from mlab don't suit my style. I'll just use it until I get my hands on an android phone..

Thanks to the symbian effort of making installations as hard as possible, you'll need to do some work to get penalti working. Mostly just installing a few extra applications. Get the game and the instructions from [the site](http://lauri.sokkelo.net/penalti).
