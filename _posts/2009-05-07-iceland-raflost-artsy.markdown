blogging from iceland during [the Raflost](http://halli.lhi.is/raflosti/) festival. Reykjavik is cool (in both senses of the word). We're building artsy stuff with people from very different backgrounds. It's fun and a valuable experience. You can't get much further than putting dancers and nerds work on the same project :)

I'm now following a lecture. Can't stop playing with processing...
