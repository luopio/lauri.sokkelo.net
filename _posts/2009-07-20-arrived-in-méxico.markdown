Arrived to México yesterday. Instead of the requested family accommodation I got placed into a hostel. Not a major drawback.. location is ok and the room is nice. First drawback was that my phone does not seem to work here.. I guess that's the perfect "excuse" to buy that Android phone that I've been thinking about.

First classes of Spanish are behind me. Nice stuff. I'm placed in the beginner B group, but I'm sure I'll be promoted in a few days :)

And the price level! This is one of the cheapest places I've been to. Prices so far: beer $12, bus $2-4, pastries from bakery ~$15, bottle of juice from store $6 (prices in pesos, not dollars. 1â‚¬ ~= $19).

México greeted me with a nice hail shower (el granizo). I'm sure the taxi car has some permanent marks of it.
