Need to write these down somewhere... random notes and experiences from the past days:

 * saw a neongreen headed punk dude with a face painted in white riging a unicycle in zona rosa ("downtown") pie a random gigolo bloke. everyone thought it was hilarious except the gigolo (who did not catch the punk). if in downtown D.F. and you see a guy riding a unicycle and carrying a pie, procede with caution..

 * finnish phones do not work here directamente. i guess there are no cooperation plans with the networks. even after you buy a ''telcel'' chip (i.e. SIM, prepaid) you'll need to "register" your phone. for that you need your new number and identification (copy of passport was enough in my case). only one place does this, and that is in Paseo de la Reforma #222.
