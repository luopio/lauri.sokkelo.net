I'm starting to feel old. Not physically, but mentally. Maybe it's the fact that I'm probably among the oldes alumnos in the school. Anyway wednesday was my birthday and I got cake! Actually two. The first was bought by my nice spanish teacher, who also made the class sing mañanitas for me ("happy birthday"-type singsongs). The problem was that we couldn't finish it during class and I had to carry it around the uni. Fortunately the people at the international office accepted it as a donation. The second cake came from my mexican family mom here. Also very tasty.

Yesterday, after a visit to [Teotihuacan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teotihuacan), we went to [Condesa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condesa) to celebrate. Was fun, but ate too many tacos.
