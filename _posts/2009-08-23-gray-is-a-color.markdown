School started two weeks ago. Took way too many courses about Mexican history, political situation, art, etc.. and one photography course from Diseño Gráfico. With all the web-stuff and artsy-mlab-stuff I'm really keeping myself busy. I guess I'll just flunk a few of the courses since I really don't need the credits.

Yesterday I was walking around my hood Colinas del Sur and noticed how here grey can be counted as a color! It really stands out among the violet, pink and green houses! Itä-Pasila would be a truly unique barrio here.

Next week: salsa lessons + hiking up a mountain
