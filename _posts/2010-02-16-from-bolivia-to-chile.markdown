A few days ago we passed the border from Bolivia to Chile. The change is quite remarkable: from one of the poorest to the most developed nation. Prices went up a lot and due to the high season here we're suffering difficulties finding accomodation.

Still some nice places here, like San Pedro de Atacama in the desert and La Serena where we are right now. Thankfully Argentina should be cheaper again :)
