I decided to redo my site ages ago but as design processes go, redesigning your own site is probably one of the most painful ones. I went from several layouts finally to this one (as usual the last one is the simplest) and I'm still not entirely happy.

I wanted to share all the fun projects I've been doing here at Medialab and give them more emphasis. At the same time I wanted to go to a one page layout to better support touchscreens in tablets and other mobile devices (and to stand out from the crowd a bit ;) )

I also had some _processing.js_ animations working in the background, but disabled them for now as the html-canvas element still seems to be quite slow.

Maybe I'll still clear out some visual noise and include some simple graphics, but for now I'll leave it as it is.
