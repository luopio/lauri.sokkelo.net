Recently it became obvious that Intgrlab, the software company we've been building since early spring, doesn't have any development work in the pipeline. Hence there is no work for me - the guy who hasn't bothered with the consulting side yet.

So I decided to start looking for new stuff! There's loads of interesting opportunities out there. For this I've finally sat down and updated this site (less clutter, contact section) to use as a portfolio and updated my CV to match my current skills. Check 'em out! Also if you happen to know anybody who needs a hardcore dev / designer.. drop me a line!
