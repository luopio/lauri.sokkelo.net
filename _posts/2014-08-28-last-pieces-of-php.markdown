Two years since the last update. This time just a slightly updated layout as most work was done under the hood with a
bunch of old PHP libraries replaced by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

Also hosting moved from a Finnish webhotel to a Digital Ocean VPS. Now I'll just commit a new post to GIT and a small
[Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) server will hear it, pull changes and rebuild the site. Handy.
