"160";"736";"text/html";"My sister wanted a blog and me being what I am, didn't even consider using a something solid and ready like wordpress, but instead used the opportunity as an excuse to build a new improved blog system.
<br />
<br />Codenamed ""Kassi"", the new blog system combines some new things I've wanted to have in KISSblog. First of, it's <b>tag-based</b> so classifying posts is a lot more flexible. Secondly it's based on the idea of *pieces*. All posts are a collection of pieces and those pieces might be text, markup, images, videos, etc. 
<br />
<br />Backend code is written in PHP5 and database connections are made via <a href=""http://adodb.sf.net"">Adodb</a> so the system should support a wide range of different databases.
<br />
<br />The whole system still relies on the same principle as KISSblog, where you need to build your own display code in PHP to get the posts visible on your page. I see homepages as something very personally styled and don't see an idea in creating a default blog page at this point. 
<br />
<br />There is an integrated AJAX-powered and scriptaculous animated frontend for posting however, so using the system just involves putting the libs in place and placing a foreach-print somewhere on your own page.
<br />
<br />I'll create a release of some sort once I've imported my own blog to the new system. Still considering releasing the software under the name <i>Kassit</i> instead of ''Kassi'', which would be a bit more fun for those who understand Finnish :)";;"0"
"161";"737";"text/html";"I went to see <a href=""http://www.kansallisteatteri.fi/www/fi/?we_objectID=58"">the Unknown Soldier</a> this week. For those who don't know the piece, it's a Finnish national epoch describing the events during the Continuation War (the war that comes after Winter War during WWII). 
<br />
<br />The play has generated a lot of controversy. It features - for example - shooting down alive and dead Finnish politics, artists and national icons, such as <a href=""http://www.yle.fi/tallennemyynti/kuvat/ransu.jpg"">Ransu</a>. Some people get offended by this and other parts of the play. Just as people got offended decades ago with the original book by Väinö Linna, which depicted the Finnish soldiers in a less ""romantic light"", i.e. they we're drinking, fleeing from the enemy and all in all being more human than the super-human finnish soldiers in earlier works of art.
<br />
<br />I have to say that the play was <b>fantastic</b>. It's a wake-up call for the slumbering Finnish spirit that is fighting for survival in the midst of globalization and commercialization. And I heartly recommend it to all. Especially those that presume that the play is something horrible :) ";;"0"
"162";"738";"text/html";"I just bought the Radiohead album ""In Rainbows"". I like RH, but I'm not a huge fan. One of the biggest motivators was the new scheme they are using to sell the album: you decide the price. I read on <a href=""http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/07/11/06/2035244.shtml"">slashdot</a> that 38% of people pay for the album with an average payment falling between $5 and $8.

The days during the summer were filled with full-time day work at <a href=""http://mlab.taik.fi"">the Medialab</a> and thesis writing/research during the evenings. Rest of the time was partying, exploring Helsinki and enjoying outdoors, and since blogging is not a high priority for me, it was forgotten.
<br />
<br /><b>But yesterday I submitted my thesis for review</b>
<br />
<br />A huge feeling of relief. I'm quite satisfied with the outcome (all 93 pages of it). For anyone starting to write their thesis, I recommend starting from a very, very small focus area and moving from there. I started BIG, and then had to cut a lot of the material and refocus on a smaller domain.

<br />I even got a Mac 15'' Powerbook as my work machine. At first I was a bit disappointed, because I had to use Mac. Then I found out the very cool features like the omni-present-hibernate (you can leave the computer ""on"" all the time) and I was pleased for some time.
<br />
<br />Then I became disappointed again :). Mostly it's because with Macs it's the Mac way of doing things. I so much prefer the Linux way of DIY, although that is mostly more harder to novice users. And I miss the multiple workspaces and compiz and ... (i know Macs have 3rd party workspace apps, but I've heard they are awful)

<br />
<br />Launchpad is a good hosting service. Easy management of all the permissions to the repositories, the bugs, translations, future plans and basic FAQs in the same place really helps focusing on the main point: code.
<br />
<br />We already have three branches there: gdesklets0.40 (a.k.a. ""trunk""), gdesklets0.35 and desklets-basic which will grow to contain a group of the best desklets and controls that can then be easily distributed as a package.

"166";"742";"text/html";"I've spend some time lately looking into the source code of <a href=""http://www.screenlets.org"">Screenlets</a> - one of the many desktop widget/desklet/gadget -solutions available on Linux these days.
<br />
<br />At first I was a bit skeptical because screenlets are just basically small python classes based on the Screenlet-superclass. Compared to the easy XML-syntax of gDesklets or the syntax that SuperKaramba uses this solution might be a bit harder to use for widget developers. However I've come to the conclusion that the idea might not be a bad one after all.
<br />
<br />Python is a <b>very</b> easy language to use and by removing the additional step of converting the widget-markup into python code, the application becomes more stable and faster on startup. Of course this makes it harder to keep malicious widgets out because all screenlets have access to all the python modules, but on the other hand it does not limit the screenlet-developers.
<br />
<br />I'm anxious to see where this project goes.. currently it seems a bit closed (no SVN, no real website) and the code needs some improvement and additional features (I already tried to help w/ a <a href=""http://lauri.sokkelo.net/files/properties_instead_of_setattr.patch"">patch</a>). I'd start thinking about a solid API at this point so that screenlet-developers could work in peace.

<br />
<br />All the Wiis have been sold out so far so we wanted to be sure about getting one... so we woke up at 5am and went in front of Gigantti. Gigantti opened up at 10am so we had about four hours of waiting to do.. Hannu took a bunch of photos, we played footbag, stood in line.
<br />
<br />Around 7:30 we noticed that people started to line up in front of the Prisma store next to Gigantti. I heard that there might be some Wiis there as well and because it opens already at 8am I went to line there around 7:40. <b>And at 8:00 I was the first one in the line who DIDN'T get a Wii</b> :(. Frustrated I went back to the Gigantti line which Hannu was holding up.
<br />
<br />We waited there.. there were only a few of us. Me, Hannu and my professor (can't reveal his name because he was lining to get one for his kids as a Christmas present). Other people showed up around 9:00am. All in all there were around 18 people lining for a Wii before the store opened at 10am.

<br />[rant] Bloody Gigantti overcharged 20e (289e instead of the basic 269e) and they didn't even have them in stock, had to come back later that day to collect mine. Lowered my opinion of Gigantti (can't get much lower..). [/rant]

</li><li>When the user clicks on a video clip, only a window playing it will appear. Nothing else. This is the thing I love about mplayer!
</li><li>OSD-support for displaying status, volume, etc. (like mplayer). BUT perhaps with interactive OSD elements like buttons.
</li><li>A context menu that appears on right click. This should be the only toolkit dependable part (Qt, GTK, etc.).
</li><li>If the user does not supply a target clip, the window will play a non-intrusive, but cool usage-video (like tips on a black background).

<br />
But just when the gdesklets community thought they would finally get rid of me, they we're mistaken! Bwahahahah :-D ! I wouldn't dream of quitting work on gD now. There's still so much to do: <u>getHTML</u> control is nearly perfect, <u>040 core</u> still needs a lot of love, <u>DD</u> awaits final touches and integration into 040, and we've just started moving management and stuff into <a href=""http://launchpad.net"">launchpad</a>.. not to mention the work needed to bring the <u>new site</u> up and working!<br />

Overall the summer was <b>magnificent</b>. I'm quite happy with all the stuff I've accomplished and (especially) learned during the it. The workplan was suprisingly well estimated. Nearly all the tasks we're completed and the average workday was quite close to the basic 6-8 hours (very, very hard to estimate). To compensate for the ""nearly"" word in the previous sentence, numerous extra features that weren't mentioned in the workplan got implemented.<br />

So what next? Well.. tomorrow I'll get up early and continue on the getHTML-control and I'll try to find the guy responsible for the gd.org site and suggest a few improvements.<br />

A tip to anyone travelling to Cambodia from Bangkok: Don't use the basic tourist busses from Khao San. Take a public bus from Mo Chit to the border town. It costs around 215 bath (4e) + tuktuk to the border + taxi to Siem Reap, so it's a bit more expensive, but saves you time as the 'scam busses'take 12h to reach Siem Reap, and as the name suggests, they tend to scam tourists on visa costs, etc..

It's obviously a very popular laptop abroad, but here in Finland I haven't seen anyone packing one. I guess the main reason is that you can't find it here anywhere in-store. You'll have to contact the corporate sales of Dell Finland and request one. 

In the end it wasn't that difficult. Just build one from e.g. Dell Sweden, send the specs to your appointed seller (better call in advance to give your details) and then confirm the purchase.

I was harassing them with a lot of questions, such as ""can I buy the laptop abroad and then order a sv-keyboard?"" and ""can I get the ubuntu laptop in Finland?"". Both were answered ""no"". The price for my laptop was around 1300e for a system with 3GB RAM, 2.40GHz processor, Nvidia 8400GS, led-display, etc.. so it's no that bad for a Finn price.

Now I've installed **Ubuntu Studio**, which kicks butt. It's an artist version of Ubuntu with spiffy graphics and a lot of audiovisual content creation programs.

"228";"796";"text/markdown";"To save the pain from others of repeating my mistakes, I'll write this short howto. In the end you should have a working system with Ubuntu, Vista and Dell MediaDirect.

1. Boot using Mediadirect CD, choose the second option and allocate how much you want for Vista (I gave the beast 50GB)
2. Install Vista
3. Boot into Vista and insert the Mediadirect CD again. Finish MD installation
4. Insert your Linux CD, boot
5. Install your flavor of Linux (I used Ubuntu Studio) by creating new partitions in the empty second partition.

After this I had a working setup with a working Mediadirect button (I could press the home-button when the computer was off and boot straight into MD)";;"0"
"229";"797";"text/markdown";"Dell Media direct proved out to be a Windows CE Embedded system with a simple media GUI. Not really useful, since it only reads FAT-drives and has no network connection.

Since it's a windows system, it only took me two minutes to break it and start ending up with a blue screen of death on each MD bootup (I honestly didn't do anything wrong.. just used it, it hanged and then I had to hard boot..).

I've been thinking about replacing the system with a quick'n'small linux distro with something like [Elisa](http://elisa.fluendo.com/) starting up instantly, so I did some research and it seems that starting with the **home button starts the MBR**, while the **normal start button fires up the active partition** (you can only have one). 

Unfortunately if I install GRUB on the linux partitions start and mark it active, vista hijacks the boot flag to its own partition. So now I have GRUB on MBR and MD still works.. for now.

** Quick how to fix your broken MD Howto **

This is what I did to fix the blue screen of MD death

1. Get the [Dell MD recovery disk](http://support.ap.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/dsn/en/document?docid=26B720E7D596B89DE040A68F5B280867&c=my&l=en&s=gen) and follow the instructions
2. After this I ended up with a broken windows install, so insert the vista CD and do the repair bit that comes after you choose the language.
3. Insert your flavor of live CD linux (I used [Puppy](http://puppylinux.com/) and I heartily recommend it)
4. Install grub to your MBR with grub-install /dev/sda

I guess I'll look into replacing the MD with a linux distro at some point. I found a [howto on it](http://caffeinbar.com/wp/2007/03/08/start-linux-with-dell-mediadirect-button/), but I really want to:
- press the power button to enter grub to choose between ""the main linux"" and vista
- press home to boot a quick, small linux for media stuff

"234";"801";"text/markdown";"Ordered myself a [fit-pc from Compulabs](http://www.fit-pc.com/new/about-fit-pc.html) from the States. Thanks to the weak dollar it was more cheaper to order it from there than from Sweden. I was first excited about getting myself a [Bubba server](http://excito.com/bubba/about-bubba.html), which would have been nicer since the shop which makes them is Swedish but technically Bubba is missing a lot of the things that fit-pc has, while consuming more power in the process (not a lot though).

Now I need to come up with a purpose for my fit-pc :). I guess I'll cram a 250GB HDD into it, install gentoo (need performance) and tweak it to run as a wifi-router/backup-server/web-photo-server/automatic-backupper/audio-player/bittorrent-downloader -mean-machine. It's claimed to be powerful enough to play basic divx-clips, but I'm not planning on putting myth or anything on it.

All this under 300e.. let's see how it turns out.	";;"0"
"235";"802";"text/markdown";"Interface Design with Electronics is one of the best workshops Mlab offers. During a five day period students get a very hands-on experience with Basic stamp microcontrollers, various sensors and other electronic stuff. As always the workshop ends with a group project. 

We did ""Mothman"", a strange audio-visual ""installation"" that reacts to ambient light and distance from viewer. We used Pure data, Processing and Basic Stamp with an ultrasound and light sensors. It was a lot of fun. Now I'm trying to come up with a new project idea that would involve sensors..

Get the code and graphics [here](http://lauri.sokkelo.net/files/moth.tar.gz). Sound excluded due to big size. For a glimpse see [the presentation we held](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1drR-8F69OM).";;"0"
"236";"803";"text/markdown";"Piece by piece I've been improving my home setup consisting of a laptop(mac), desktop(linux) and small server(fit-pc w/ linux). I'm fairly happy with what I've got now. Not only does the small server run '''trac/svn/lighttpd+php''' for development, it also serves as a backup server through a few '''rsync''' scripts running over ssh and a torrent downloader via '''rtorrent'''.

Once the linux wlan drivers support master mode, I can also use the box as a WLAN access point, getting rid of one more appliance.

One very pleasant thing I just accomplished was setting [Pulseaudio](http://www.pulseaudio.org) to run as a server. Now I can either play music via MPD or stream it directly from my desktop (and it's dead simple - I just pick the output sink with a few clicks). Reminds me of the streaming support in apple airport stations, which I always thought was cool. Of course Pulseaudio does this and a [lot, lot more](http://www.pulseaudio.org/wiki/FAQ).

Now I'm just waiting for the Android phones to hit Finland.. then my - by then self-aware - home audio system will be complete (except for obvious bits, like good speakers and a decent amplifier)..	";;"0"

This time I had something to show as well. A simple idea based on photo compositions. In short I created scripts that downloaded all the mlabber photos from the net, analyzed them and created copies of them by composing all the images together. Then I created a [Processing](http://www.processing.org) visualization using some of the OpenGL stuff it provides. Below is my image composed.";;"0"

The end result was the magical milk can. Rotating the can controls the rotation of the images, moving your hand towards the bottom of the can makes the images fly faster. Simple, useless, confusing but a lot of fun to create and use.";;"2"

"241";"805";"text/markdown";"I'm just taking the realtime visuals workshop here in TaiK and while playing around with Isadora (the app we're using) I started wondering if there's something for Gstreamer that does the same.

Live Cinema is basically about modifying video clips and effects in real time. A lot of these apps rely on sets of patches (another example would be puredata), which usually are a set of components relying and transforming the data before it ends up on the screen.

Gstreamer does this on the low-level. You can do these ""patches"" even directly through the command line. These include effects. I figured there has to be a gst app for these things, but there isn't.. the only one I found was [Gstreamer Editor](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/modules/gst-editor.html)).

I think it would be cool to create one. This could also result in a lot of new effects available for gst. Perhaps one could use [Clutter](http://clutter-project.org) for the UI :).";;"0"
"242";"806";"text/markdown";"After a few days of tinkering and a few days of waiting for the right parts to arrive I've finally managed to connect an Arduino board to a Nokia N800 internet tablet. First steps towards the Mlab robot.. I was really happy to find out how hackable the internet tablets are! Although there are numerous tutorials around the web, I'll put a short description of what I did before I forget:

# Steps to connect N800 to Arduino #
1. update N800 to OS2008
1. install rootsh to gain super-user access
1. install USB Control (enable Chinook Extras repository)
1. enable host mode through usb control
1. get a *female type A-female type A* USB connector. You might need to solder your USB-USBmini cable a bit if it's only slave mode. I bought one cheap from <verkkokauppa.com> and it seems to work both ways out of the box. I guess you can also use an external power source if you don't want to solder your cable(?).
1. get kernel modules for USB Serial communication and FTDI chips from <http://fanoush.wz.cz/maemo/modules-rx-34-2.6.21.0.tar.gz>
1. unpack and install kernel modules **as root** with

 *insmod usbserial.ko*

 *insmod ftdi_sio.ko*

1. plug in your arduino

## Extra: Python testing
1. get [PySerial](http://pyserial.wiki.sourceforge.net/pySerial) and install it. You can also just copy the python module from some *nix computer (I just copied mine from my linux box)
1. run this:

        import serial

        ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 9600)

        while 1:

            print ser.readline()


you should see whatever your arduino chip is printing.

Voilá! You have a connected a very flexible development board with a very hacker friendly, touchscreen enabled linux computer! Think of the possibilities :)									";;"1"

"245";"808";"text/markdown";"Silently we (me and Jari Suominen from Medialab) released PENALTI - a fun ball racing game that uses the accelerometer available on many symbian (s60) phones. The idea started from mlab's Rapid Mobile Prototyping workshop and was fueled by Nokia Forum Game Development challenge.

We did a few days of intensive coding and submitted our game. Didn't win the whole thing, but we were the best in TaiK (dunno, if anyone else participated :) ). Prize? A Nokia 5800 phone. Suits me fine, since my trustworthy ericsson is falling apart and the N95's from mlab don't suit my style. I'll just use it until I get my hands on an android phone..

Thanks to the symbian effort of making installations as hard as possible, you'll need to do some work to get penalti working. Mostly just installing a few extra applications. Get the game and the instructions from [the site](http://lauri.sokkelo.net/penalti).		";;"0"

the bigger issue is the need to learn spanish in advance. i was planning on taking a course in spain during the summer, but many people directed me to a more better approach of taking a course before the school starts in mexico city, so now i'm hunting for a course there. at least i'll save the airline tickets and won't pollute, but i would've wanted to visit spain as well.. some day..

 * finnish phones do not work here directamente. i guess there are no cooperation plans with the networks. even after you buy a ''telcel'' chip (i.e. SIM, prepaid) you'll need to ""register"" your phone. for that you need your new number and identification (copy of passport was enough in my case). only one place does this, and that is in Paseo de la Reforma #222.

First I want to introduce the most important food for me so far: *tacos*. Especially *Tacos al pastor*, which could somehow be described as a delicious kebab (real - Turkish, not Finnish) meets Mexican spices and other ingredients, such as Tortillas.

"258";"814";"text/markdown";"Then a few quick fixes:
 
 - the tortillas we have in Finland (and presumably the rest of the Western World) are *arab tortillas* Locals here are not as big, but there are arab versions available if you want (this also explains why they are common in the east).
 - fajitas are a joke.. original meaning here is the pieces of meat that don't get used. Not a food here.
 - burritos are not Mexican. Invented in the U.S. (perhaps by Mexican immigrates).
 - quesadillas do exist. They are tortillas filled with cheese and other ingredients.
 - nachos also exits, but I haven't yet encountered nacho plates that they serve in ""Mexican"" restaurants outside MX.

Of course México is a huge country (compare to central Europe) and I haven't been outside D.F. yet. I might have more complaining to do once I've visited other places as well :)		";;"2"

Aino got a combination of different illnesses including salmonella which forced her to drop the trip, while I participated (no refunds, no other good dates).

Still some nice places here, like San Pedro de Atacama in the desert and La Serena where we are right now. Thankfully Argentina should be cheaper again :)";;"0"
"289";"827";"text/markdown";"So the last post was from Chile. Weeks have passed since and we've seen more and more of Chile (avoiding the devastating earthquake by less than a day), and now we're in Buenos Aires. Argentina has been very nice. Iguazu falls were incredible although very touristy, as such places tend to be.

Just a few days left now. Around 9 months since I left Finland. Wonder if I'll suffer the biggest culture shock once I land in Vantaa.. not really looking forward to it much: it's >25 degrees here, yesterday rained (and they cancelled the [Superclásico](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercl%C3%A1sico)), but most days are sunny.

Buenos Aires is really nice. Almost as nice as DF in México (I'm biased of course). Having our own apartment in Palermo makes the experience even better and not really that much more expensive since we're three now that Eeva has joined us.	";;"0"
"290";"828";"text/markdown";"The need to code ""something completely different"" made me do **Background Shuffler** - a beautiful background changer for Gnome. I wanted to extend the [UNIX philosophy](http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html) to desktop applications so Background Shuffler only changes your background. It does not make coffee.

So I spent a few days hacking and with the help of great tools and libraries like [Quickly](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Quickly) and [appindicator](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/lucid/+package/python-appindicator) I managed to build this nifty little program that I'm using all the time now.

Features:

* handle all through the **indicator icon**. No mysterious script running in the background, retain complete control over your desktop at all times
* make the backgrounds change as quickly or slowly as you like
* integrates with **F-Spot**, so search for certain tags or ratings
* optionally specify a **folder** that will be searched with photos

But I guess screenshots explain a thousand words.					";;"0"

"294";"829";"text/markdown";"I decided to redo my site ages ago but as design processes go, redesigning your own site is probably one of the most painful ones. I went from several layouts finally to this one (as usual the last one is the simplest) and I'm still not entirely happy.

I wanted to share all the fun projects I've been doing here at Medialab and give them more emphasis. At the same time I wanted to go to a one page layout to better support touchscreens in tablets and other mobile devices (and to stand out from the crowd a bit ;) )

I also had some _processing.js_ animations working in the background, but disabled them for now as the html-canvas element still seems to be quite slow.

Maybe I'll still clear out some visual noise and include some simple graphics, but for now I'll leave it as it is.		";;"0"

So I decided to start looking for new stuff! There's loads of interesting opportunities out there. For this I've finally sat down and updated this site (less clutter, contact section) to use as a portfolio and updated my CV to match my current skills. Check 'em out! Also if you happen to know anybody who needs a hardcore dev / designer.. drop me a line!";;"0"

Also some notable projects we've cooked up with the Reuna crew are here now. Archive Flow and History flow are worth checking out. Hopefully I'll get a chance to do more of these in the future.

Also I've been playing around with Beagle bone - a hacker friendly SOC Linux computer. Here's an image of a latest few hour hack based on my [Python Thermal Printer library](https://github.com/luopio/py-thermal-printer/). It's a Ghetto polaroid camera. Flip the switch and it'll take a quick photo and print it out with the thermal printer.	";;"0"
