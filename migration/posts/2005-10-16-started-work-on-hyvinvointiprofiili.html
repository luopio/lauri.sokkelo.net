We did a new contract with Opetushallitus and continued work on Koulun Hyvinvointiprofiili. We decided to go more pro this time and I installed Subversion and created a repository for the project. I also changed from using Bluefish into using Eclipse with phpEclipse. Bluefish is an brilliant editor, but I just wanted to try Eclipse for a change (and this far eclipse seems even better).
