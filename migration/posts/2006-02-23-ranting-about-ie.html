[rant]The problem using Linux is that I can't test my pages with M$ Internet Exploder :-P. Again I noticed that IE doesn't respect background images and colors used at the same time (hence the grey bits in the corners) and style-definitions for the submenu links we're creatively ignored. <br />
<br />
It <b>should</b> be fixed now. Can't really promise anything, since <i>I can't test it on IE (too lazy to boot into windows)</i>.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to slap one of those "This page is best viewed with blaablaa" -tags here! No way! Although I'm highly tempted. [/rant]
