Well my employment for the summer is looking quite smooth this year: just got hired to develop the environment for IOI (<a href="http://www.ioi2006.org">International Olympiad in Informatics </a>). This should take me about one month and then after that I can start really working on gDesklets with the support from COSS. <br />
<br />
I'm thinking about using the Ubuntu Dapper live-cd for the IOI-environment.. I know it's a bit experimental, but asking around #ubuntu-fi let me to believe that it should work fine. Not only would Dapper give a superb, state-of-the-art linux environment, it would also offer the Espresso installer that makes it possible to install the distribution from the LiveCD into the hardrive - a feature that was missed with the previous liveCD based on Morphix.<br />
<br />
Well see.. all this experimenting will probably backfire on me like usual :)
