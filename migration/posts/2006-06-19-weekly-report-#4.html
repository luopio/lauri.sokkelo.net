Came back from the trip and started working full-time again. Accomplishments:<br />
* AudioPlayer-control works. Segfaults removed, interface improved.<br />
* BoomBox is born: a desklet to test the functionality of the audioplayer. Screenshot <a href="http://lauri.sokkelo.net/gdesklets/boombox.png">here</a>. <br />
* Now I'll move on to writing the beagle control (might be difficult, 'cos I can't find any docs)<br />
<br />
<b>And from now on I'll write the weekly report each sunday</b>
