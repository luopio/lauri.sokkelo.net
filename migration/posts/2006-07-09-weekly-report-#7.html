* Started on the GUI. Discussion and shell mockups can be seen <a href="http://gdesklets.gotdns.org/gDeskletsWiki/DeskletsDesklet">here</a><br />
* Created DOMv2 - a modified version of the internal desklet structure that supports hierachical referencing. This was my first serious dive into the core of gD and it was rather positive - sparking a new wikipage and discussion: http://gdesklets.gotdns.org/gDeskletsWiki/DOMv2<br />
* Next week I'll continue on the shell and improve DOMv2. Then I'll think about creating <a href="http://gdesklets.gotdns.org/gDeskletsWiki/Proposali18n">i18n support</a> and style support as IMHO these are features that should be implemented before the new GUI itself.<br />
<br />
DOMv2 can be taken from the <a href="http://gdesklets.gotdns.org/gDeskletsWiki/SvnRepository">SVN repo </a> or seen <a href="http://lauri.sokkelo.net/gdesklets">here</a>
