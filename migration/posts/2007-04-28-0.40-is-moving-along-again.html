We moved the 0.40 prototype from Chris' on/off SVN repository to <a href="http://launchpad.net">Launchpad</a> and the move was worth it: 0.40 is making progress again and we're seeing new developers writing blueprints and uploading code!
<br />
<br />Launchpad is a good hosting service. Easy management of all the permissions to the repositories, the bugs, translations, future plans and basic FAQs in the same place really helps focusing on the main point: code.
<br />
<br />We already have three branches there: gdesklets0.40 (a.k.a. "trunk"), gdesklets0.35 and desklets-basic which will grow to contain a group of the best desklets and controls that can then be easily distributed as a package.
<br />
