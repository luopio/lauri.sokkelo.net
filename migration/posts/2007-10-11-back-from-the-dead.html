Haven't been writing much lately. The reason mostly lies in the fact that I've been very busy. The days during the summer were filled with full-time day work at <a href="http://mlab.taik.fi">the Medialab</a> and thesis writing/research during the evenings. Rest of the time was partying, exploring Helsinki and enjoying outdoors, and since blogging is not a high priority for me, it was forgotten.
<br />
<br /><b>But yesterday I submitted my thesis for review</b>
<br />
<br />A huge feeling of relief. I'm quite satisfied with the outcome (all 93 pages of it). For anyone starting to write their thesis, I recommend starting from a very, very small focus area and moving from there. I started BIG, and then had to cut a lot of the material and refocus on a smaller domain.
<br />
<br />Hopefully the professor is also satisfied :)
