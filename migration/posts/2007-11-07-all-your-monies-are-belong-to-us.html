I just bought the Radiohead album "In Rainbows". I like RH, but I'm not a huge fan. One of the biggest motivators was the new scheme they are using to sell the album: you decide the price. I read on <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/07/11/06/2035244.shtml">slashdot</a> that 38% of people pay for the album with an average payment falling between $5 and $8. Considering the greedy nature of us humans, I'd say 38% is a good turnout. And btw I paid 10e. Try to top that :)

<br />Enough blabbering.. back to XUL, event loops and threads. A battle I've been fighting for a few days (for those fighting the same battles I recommend <a href="http://wirestorm.net/blog/?cat=9">this posting</a> (which was surprisingly hard to find)
