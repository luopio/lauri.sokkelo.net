My sister wanted a blog and me being what I am, didn't even consider using a something solid and ready like wordpress, but instead used the opportunity as an excuse to build a new improved blog system.
<br />
<br />Codenamed "Kassi", the new blog system combines some new things I've wanted to have in KISSblog. First of, it's <b>tag-based</b> so classifying posts is a lot more flexible. Secondly it's based on the idea of *pieces*. All posts are a collection of pieces and those pieces might be text, markup, images, videos, etc. 
<br />
<br />Backend code is written in PHP5 and database connections are made via <a href="http://adodb.sf.net">Adodb</a> so the system should support a wide range of different databases.
<br />
<br />The whole system still relies on the same principle as KISSblog, where you need to build your own display code in PHP to get the posts visible on your page. I see homepages as something very personally styled and don't see an idea in creating a default blog page at this point. 
<br />
<br />There is an integrated AJAX-powered and scriptaculous animated frontend for posting however, so using the system just involves putting the libs in place and placing a foreach-print somewhere on your own page.
<br />
<br />I'll create a release of some sort once I've imported my own blog to the new system. Still considering releasing the software under the name <i>Kassit</i> instead of ''Kassi'', which would be a bit more fun for those who understand Finnish :)
