Stopping by at Khao San road - the notorious travellerghetto in Bangkok. We'll be catching a bus today to try and reach the border.

Last night I broke my arm, while climbing down from my bed on the train from Malaysia. Hurts like hell. Probably just a spasm, but will surely annoy me for a few days.  

Khao San seems interesting as a money wasting target. Perhaps we'll stop here on our way back and buy some traditional traveller garbage - like a T-shirt that has a picture of a married couple and the text "Game Over".. not sure if Aino would appreciate it :)
