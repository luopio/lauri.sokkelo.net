Interface Design with Electronics is one of the best workshops Mlab offers. During a five day period students get a very hands-on experience with Basic stamp microcontrollers, various sensors and other electronic stuff. As always the workshop ends with a group project. 

We did "Mothman", a strange audio-visual "installation" that reacts to ambient light and distance from viewer. We used Pure data, Processing and Basic Stamp with an ultrasound and light sensors. It was a lot of fun. Now I'm trying to come up with a new project idea that would involve sensors..

Get the code and graphics [here](http://lauri.sokkelo.net/files/moth.tar.gz). Sound excluded due to big size. For a glimpse see [the presentation we held](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1drR-8F69OM).
