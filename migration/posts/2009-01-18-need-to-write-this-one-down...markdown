> A man flying in a hot air balloon suddenly realizes heâ€™s lost. He reduces height and spots a man down below. He lowers the balloon further and shouts to get directions, "Excuse me, can you tell me where I am?"

> The man below says: "Yes, you're in a hot air balloon, hovering 30 feet above this field."

> "You must work in Information Technology," says the balloonist.

> "I do" replies the man. "How did you know?"

> "Well," says the balloonist, "everything you have told me is technically correct, but It's of no use to anyone." The man below replies, "You must work in management."

> "I do" replies the balloonist, "But how'd you know?"

> "Well", says the man, "you donâ€™t know where you are, or where youâ€™re going, you expect me to be able to help. Youâ€™re in the same position you were before we met, but now itâ€™s my fault."
