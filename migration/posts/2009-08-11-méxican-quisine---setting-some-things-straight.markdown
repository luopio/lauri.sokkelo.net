After around three weeks here, I feel confident to say that all the food I've had in Finland under the adjective "Mexican" is a lie. I knew it wasn't correct, but had no idea it would be this far off..

First I want to introduce the most important food for me so far: *tacos*. Especially *Tacos al pastor*, which could somehow be described as a delicious kebab (real - Turkish, not Finnish) meets Mexican spices and other ingredients, such as Tortillas. Normally you savour them with a selection of different salsas, lime, etc.

Then a few quick fixes:
 
 - the tortillas we have in Finland (and presumably the rest of the Western World) are *arab tortillas* Locals here are not as big, but there are arab versions available if you want (this also explains why they are common in the east).
 - fajitas are a joke.. original meaning here is the pieces of meat that don't get used. Not a food here.
 - burritos are not Mexican. Invented in the U.S. (perhaps by Mexican immigrates).
 - quesadillas do exist. They are tortillas filled with cheese and other ingredients.
 - nachos also exits, but I haven't yet encountered nacho plates that they serve in "Mexican" restaurants outside MX.

Of course México is a huge country (compare to central Europe) and I haven't been outside D.F. yet. I might have more complaining to do once I've visited other places as well :)
