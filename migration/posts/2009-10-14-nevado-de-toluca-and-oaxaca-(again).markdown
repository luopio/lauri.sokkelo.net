Just a quick note on what I've been up to since the past weeks.

 - Bought a plane ticket to San Francisco to visit Mikko in Santa Clara. This will unfortunately mean I'll miss Day of the Dead (a BIG minus), but at least I'll have a reason to return to México one day

 - Climbed a mountain. Personal best is now 4660m. Incredible headache, sunburns and other pains followed, but it was worth it. See pics below.

 - Visited Oaxaca again. This time with the photography class. Saw some of the same places again, but also a few new ones, like the tree of Tule, which was quite amazing.
