Returned yesterday from a tour on the Mexican south-southwest coast. Went through Zipolite-Mazunte-Puerto Escondido-Acapulco-Zihuatanejo in a bit under 2 weeks. Mazunte was the best, Acapulco the worst. No surprise there. 

During the 9 hour busride the environment changed from the continuous 30 degree beach to plus 15 or so here in DF. And it's great! I can wear a sweater! And I'm not sweating all the time!

Tomorrow I'm out of Mexico... off to South America. Sad to leave the good ol MX behind, but on the other hand it'll be nice to find entirely new places.
