So the last post was from Chile. Weeks have passed since and we've seen more and more of Chile (avoiding the devastating earthquake by less than a day), and now we're in Buenos Aires. Argentina has been very nice. Iguazu falls were incredible although very touristy, as such places tend to be.

Just a few days left now. Around 9 months since I left Finland. Wonder if I'll suffer the biggest culture shock once I land in Vantaa.. not really looking forward to it much: it's >25 degrees here, yesterday rained (and they cancelled the [Superclásico](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercl%C3%A1sico)), but most days are sunny.

Buenos Aires is really nice. Almost as nice as DF in México (I'm biased of course). Having our own apartment in Palermo makes the experience even better and not really that much more expensive since we're three now that Eeva has joined us.
